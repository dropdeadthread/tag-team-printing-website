# üéØ GIT BRANCHES - SIMPLE GUIDE

**Created:** October 18, 2025  
**Status:** Fix applied to local files

---

## ‚úÖ **WHAT I JUST DID**

I fixed the image URL bug in your local file:

- **File changed:** `src/templates/SimpleProductPageTemplate.jsx`
- **What was fixed:** Image URLs now use `process.env.NODE_ENV` instead of checking `window.location.hostname`
- **Why this fixes deployment:** It works during both build-time and run-time

Your local files are now ready to commit and push!

---

## üå≥ **WHAT ARE GIT BRANCHES? (Simple Explanation)**

Think of git branches like **parallel universes** for your code:

- **main branch** = Your "official" website code that's live on Netlify
- **fix branch** = A separate copy where you test changes safely

**Benefits:**
‚úÖ Your main code stays safe while you test  
‚úÖ Easy to experiment without breaking things  
‚úÖ Can review changes before merging  
‚úÖ If something goes wrong, just delete the branch!

---

## üìã **STEP-BY-STEP: USING THE FIX**

### **Step 1: Open Terminal/Command Prompt**

Navigate to your project:

```bash
cd "C:\Users\Stacey\Documents\tag team printing website\tag team printing website"
```

### **Step 2: Create a Safe Branch** ‚ú®

```bash
git checkout -b fix/image-urls-netlify
```

**What this does:** Creates a new branch called `fix/image-urls-netlify` and switches to it.  
**Translation:** "Make a copy of my code so I can test the fix without touching the main version"

### **Step 3: Check What Changed**

```bash
git status
```

You should see:

```
modified:   src/templates/SimpleProductPageTemplate.jsx
```

Want to see the exact changes?

```bash
git diff src/templates/SimpleProductPageTemplate.jsx
```

(Press `q` to exit when you're done looking)

### **Step 4: Commit the Fix** üì¶

```bash
git add src/templates/SimpleProductPageTemplate.jsx

git commit -m "fix: Use process.env.NODE_ENV for image URLs to fix Netlify deployment

- Replaces window.location.hostname checks with process.env.NODE_ENV
- Adds centralized getImageUrl helper function
- Fixes SSR issues during Gatsby build on Netlify
- Images now correctly proxy through /ss-images/ in production"
```

**What this does:** Saves your changes with a description of what you fixed.

### **Step 5: Test Locally First** üß™

Before pushing to GitHub, test that it still works locally:

```bash
npm run clean
npm run build
```

Wait for it to finish building (should say "Created X product pages").

Then serve it:

```bash
npm run serve
```

Open `http://localhost:9000` in your browser and check:

- ‚úÖ Product pages load
- ‚úÖ Images show up
- ‚úÖ No errors in console (Press F12 ‚Üí Console tab)

If everything works, press `Ctrl+C` to stop the server.

### **Step 6: Push to GitHub** üöÄ

```bash
git push origin fix/image-urls-netlify
```

**What this does:** Uploads your fix branch to GitHub (but doesn't affect your main branch yet!)

---

## üé¨ **WHAT HAPPENS NEXT ON GITHUB**

After you push, GitHub will show you a message like:

```
Create a pull request for 'fix/image-urls-netlify' on GitHub
```

### **Option A: Merge via GitHub (RECOMMENDED)**

1. Go to GitHub: https://github.com/dropdeadthread/tag-team-printing-website
2. You'll see a yellow banner: "fix/image-urls-netlify had recent pushes"
3. Click **"Compare & pull request"**
4. Review the changes (green = added, red = removed)
5. Click **"Create pull request"**
6. Review one more time
7. Click **"Merge pull request"**
8. Click **"Confirm merge"**
9. Click **"Delete branch"** (optional cleanup)

**What happens:**

- ‚úÖ Your fix gets merged into main
- ‚úÖ Netlify automatically detects the change
- ‚úÖ Netlify builds and deploys the site
- ‚úÖ You get a notification when it's live

### **Option B: Merge via Command Line (FASTER)**

If you're feeling confident:

```bash
# Switch back to main branch
git checkout main

# Merge the fix
git merge fix/image-urls-netlify

# Push to GitHub (this triggers Netlify)
git push origin main

# Optional: Delete the fix branch since we're done with it
git branch -d fix/image-urls-netlify
git push origin --delete fix/image-urls-netlify
```

## üîç **MONITORING THE DEPLOYMENT**

### **Watch Netlify Build:**

1. Go to Netlify Dashboard
2. Click on your site
3. Go to **"Deploys"** tab
4. Watch the build log scroll by

**Look for these good signs:**

```
‚úÖ Created [NUMBER] product pages
‚úÖ success Building production JavaScript and CSS bundles
‚úÖ Site is live ‚ú®
```

### **Check the Live Site:**

1. Visit your live URL: `https://tagteamprints.com`
2. Click on a product
3. Check if images load
4. Open browser console (F12) - should be no errors

---

## üÜò **IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG**

### **Scenario 1: Build Fails on Netlify**

**Check the build log for errors.** Most likely causes:

- Syntax error (typo in the code)
- Missing environment variables

**How to fix:**

1. Fix the error locally
2. Commit again: `git add . && git commit -m "fix: corrected typo"`
3. Push again: `git push origin fix/image-urls-netlify` (or main, depending on which branch you're on)

### **Scenario 2: Images Still Don't Load**

**Check:**

1. Are the `/ss-images/` Netlify functions deployed?
   - Go to Netlify ‚Üí Functions tab
   - Should see `ss-images` listed
2. Are environment variables set?
   - Go to Netlify ‚Üí Site Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
   - Check `SNS_API_USERNAME` and `SNS_API_KEY` exist

### **Scenario 3: Want to Undo Everything**

**If you haven't pushed to main yet:**

```bash
# Switch back to main (nothing changed there!)
git checkout main

# Delete the fix branch
git branch -D fix/image-urls-netlify
```

**If you already pushed to main:**

```bash
# Revert to the previous version
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
```

---

## üìö **QUICK REFERENCE**

### **Common Git Commands:**

```bash
# See what branch you're on
git branch

# Switch branches
git checkout main
git checkout fix/image-urls-netlify

# See what changed
git status
git diff

# Undo changes to a file (before committing)
git checkout -- src/templates/SimpleProductPageTemplate.jsx

# See commit history
git log --oneline

# Push to GitHub
git push origin [branch-name]
```

### **Your Branches:**

- **main** = Your live/production code
- **fix/image-urls-netlify** = The fix we just made (temporary)

After merging, you can delete the fix branch - you don't need it anymore!

---

## ‚úÖ **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

After the deployment, you should have:

‚úÖ Netlify build completes without errors  
‚úÖ Product pages are generated (check build log)  
‚úÖ Images load on live site  
‚úÖ No console errors in browser  
‚úÖ Color selection changes images  
‚úÖ All product pages accessible

---

## üí° **PRO TIP**

From now on, whenever you want to make changes:

1. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature`
2. Make your changes
3. Test locally
4. Push: `git push origin feature/my-new-feature`
5. Merge via GitHub or command line
6. Delete the branch when done

This way, your main branch stays clean and you can always go back if needed!
