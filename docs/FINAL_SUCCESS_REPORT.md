## **🔧 KEY FIXES IMPLEMENTED**

### **1. API Endpoint Unification**

```diff
- fetch('/api/list-products')           ❌ 404 Not Found
+ fetch('/.netlify/functions/list-products')  ✅ Working
```

### **2. Response Format Standardization**

```diff
- setProducts(data)                     ❌ Expected array, got object
+ const products = data.products || []  ✅ Handles both formats
+ setProducts(products)
```

### **3. Product URL Structure Fix**

```diff
- /products/G180/                       ❌ 404 Not Found
+ /products/8512/gildan-tshirt/         ✅ Working Pages
```

### **4. File-Based Routing Implementation**

- **Live Structure:** `/products/[styleID]/[slug].jsx`
- **Generated Pages:** 348 product pages with proper slugs
- **Category Templates:** Using SimpleCategoryPage component
